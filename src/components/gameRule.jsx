                                    The goal of the game is to require the player to correctly guess a password from a list of same length words.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The player has only 4 guesses and on each incorrect guess the computer will indicate how many letter positions are correct.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                For example, if the password is DANCE and the player guesses DENSE, the game will indicate that 4 out of 5 positions are correct (D_NCE). Likewise, if the password is HOPEFUL and the player guesses DANCING, the game will report 0/7 because while some of the letters match, they're in the wrong position.  The view should maintain both a history of the userâ€™s input as well as a history of how well they did in previous sections.
                            </p>

                                Ask the player for a difficulty (very easy, easy, average, hard, very hard), then present the player with 5 to 15 words of the same length. The length can be 4 to 15 letters. More words and letters make for a harder puzzle. The player then has 4 guesses, and on each incorrect guess indicate the number of correct positions.
